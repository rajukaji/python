Introduction
Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) unsorted element
 and placing it towards the beginning of the list.

Suppose we need to sort a list in ascending order using selection sort.

Here's how it works:

Select the smallest element from the list.
Swap this element with the first element.
At this point, the correct element is placed at the first position. However, the portion of the list
 from the second position to the last remains unsorted. Therefore,

Select the smallest element from the remaining unsorted part (from the second to last positions) of the list.
Swap this element with the second element.
Continue this process for each following position until the entire list is sorted.
Next, we will visualize the workings of selection sort using images. This will provide a clearer 
understanding of how selection sort functions.


Time complexity:

Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
Best Case Complexity: O(n2)
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)


Space complexity:

The space complexity of the selection sort is O(1) because it only requires a constant amount 
of additional space for its variables.
